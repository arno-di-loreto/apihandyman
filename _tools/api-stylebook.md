I started this project with a simple API Design Guidelines list in mind and ended with a fully analyzed collection of API design guidelines. I created it for others but I use it myself too. When I wonder how to handle some API design matters, I select the related topic and read how others handle it. To be honest, it needs some refresh, it is a real pain to update and maintain and could be more user friendly; that's on my todo list.

The API Stylebook aims to help API Designers find answers to API design questions and build their own API design guidelines by providing quick and easy access to categorized and analyzed API Design Guidelines.
