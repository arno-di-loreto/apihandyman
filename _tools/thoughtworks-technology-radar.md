Thoughtworks is a quite famous software consultancy company, brilliant minds such as [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/) are working there.
Every 6 months, they publish their Technology Radar that I enjoy reading to discover new trends, techniques and tools and also to confront my own views to theirs about topics I'm already aware of.

> The Radar is a document that sets out the changes that we think are currently interesting in software development - things in motion that we think you should pay attention to and consider using in your projects. It reflects the idiosyncratic opinion of a bunch of senior technologists and is based on our day-to-day work and experiences. While we think this is interesting, it shouldnâ€™t be taken as a deep market analysis.
