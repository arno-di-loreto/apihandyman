The OpenAPI map needs a refresh to supports OpenAPI 3.1 and I wanted to do a similar thing for AsyncAPI. I started to work on toolings that takes the OpenAPI markdown specification and turn it into data and I built a prototype to render it. Everything you want to know about each version of both specifications is there.
