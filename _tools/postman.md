I use Postman to do API call when I learn to use a new API. It's also very powerful and convenient to document API, I try to always have a Postman collection in the code repositories of the APIs I build and if possible, I share it in a public Postman workspace. Postman's runner feature is incredibly useful to batch API calls with data coming from CSV files.
