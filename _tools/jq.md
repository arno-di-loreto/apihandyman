Ever wanted to quickly find, extract or modify data coming from some JSON documents on the command line? JQ is the tool youâ€™re looking for. I use it every time I need to transform, modify or extract some properties from an API's response or analyze OpenAPI specification JSON files during my API reviews.

JQ is like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text.
