This post is a "Postman Tips And Tricks Post" in which I share the tips and tricks I learn while using Postman.
You can either:

- Read this post
- Read the collection documentation on [Postman network]({{page.postman_collection_documentation}})
- Use this [![Run in Postman](/images/commons/run-in-postman.svg)]({{page.postman_collection_run}}) button to fork the collection directly in Postman
- Get the collection from [Github]({{page.postman_collection_github}}) to import it in Postman.

_(Click on the "View complete collection documentation" link in lower right corner to see documentation in full screen after import or fork)_

You can also see all of the collections of this series in my [{{page.postman_workspace}}]({{page.postman_workspace_url}}) Postman Workspace.
