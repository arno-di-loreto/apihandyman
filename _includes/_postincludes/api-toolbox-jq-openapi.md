JQ's <a href="{{site.data.jq.links.documentation.url}}" target="{{site.data.jq.link_target}}">documentation</a> is quite complete and there are many tutorials and Stackoverflow answers, so why bother writing this series? First reason, I regularly meet people working with APIs and/or JSON files who actually don't know JQ exists and how it could save their life (or at least their time). Second reason, I often use it with OpenAPI specification files and I found that showing how JQ can be used on such a widely adopted and familiar JSON based format could help to learn how to use it (and also writing this post actually helped me to improve my JQ skills!).
