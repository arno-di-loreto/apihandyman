This series aims to provide complete cross-version reference documentation about the OpenAPI Specification aggregating different sources of information. For each analyzed element, you'll find its definition, how it evolved across the different versions of the specification, how it is used and misused and where to find more information about it. This structure may evolve with future posts.

This series' posts are not intended to be actionable tutorials, they may be of interest to people involved in the evolution of the specification or creating tools, and also advanced OpenAPI nerds. Most of this content will probably be incorporated in the next version of the [OpenAPI Map](https://apihandyman.io/toolbox/openapi-map/) and be useful for more actionable series/posts about OpenAPI and Spectral.
