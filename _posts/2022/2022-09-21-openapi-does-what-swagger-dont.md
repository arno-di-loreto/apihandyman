Let's compare versions Swagger 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.0, and 3.1 to demonstrate the benefits of the new features introduced by 3.x versions to create more precise, better documented, more practical, and future-proof API contract descriptions.

# Abstract

It hurts, but though OpenAPI 3 is five years old and has more features, many people still use its previous version: Swagger 2.0. It’s high time that this changes. Inspired by the ‘90s “Sega Does What Nintendon’t” advertising campaign, Arnaud Lauret will compare versions 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1 of the specification, demonstrating the benefits of the new features introduced by 3.x versions to create more precise, better documented, more practical, and future-proof API contract descriptions.

Why do so? Because having a better understanding of the capabilities of the new versions and thus knowing what they are missing will perhaps push users and creators to say goodbye and thank you to Swagger 2.0 and hello to OpenAPI 3.x. It may also help OpenAPI 3.x users discover features they were not aware of.
