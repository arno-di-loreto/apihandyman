This talk was given at the API Days Interface 2021 conference.

# Abstract

In order to achieve successful API initiative(s), one organization MUST create the best APIs, either they are public or private. And most important, that organization must do that consistently in the long run and at scale. How can this be done? With the proper API governance. For many, it is a scary word, but it’s up to us, API practitioners to make that change and make people love governance.

During this session, Arnaud Lauret, the API Handyman, Author of The Design Of Web APIs and  API & Architecture Leader at Natixis, a french financial group, will describe why API governance is needed and share his experience helping many different teams creating APIs in a large organization and helping them build a human centered and pragmatic API governance focusing more on helping and training people than controlling and coercing them.
