If you want to discover the OpenAPI Specification format, this video is for you!
In my first ever (recorded) live coding session, given at the 2021 Manning API Conference,
I demonstrate basic, advanced, and even hidden features that will help you to efficiently create complete, accurate, and maintainable API descriptions when designing documenting APIs.

If you want to learn how I did that session, you can read my [Surviving my first (recorded) live code session post series](/setting-up-everything-to-record-myself-coding-and-talking/).
I share all what I’ve learned preparing it: how I prepared the content, the tools I used, and the struggles and doubts I had.

The OpenAPI Specification has become an industry standard to describe Web APIs during design phase or to create API documentation. During this session, Arnaud Lauret will demonstrate how to take advantage of OpenAPI specification’s basic to advanced features to efficiently create complete, accurate, maintainable and user friendly API descriptions.
