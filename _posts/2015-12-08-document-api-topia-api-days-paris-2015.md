I gave a Star Wars themed talk with a lightsaber about my new passion, documentation, at API Days Paris 2015. 

Yes, a talk about *D-O-C-U-M-E-N-T-A-T-I-O-N*. 
Yes, a *S-T-A-R W-A-R-S* themed talk.
Yes, I gave this talk holding a *L-I-G-H-T-S-A-B-E-R*.<!--more-->

I had the luck to be helped by two great persons when preparing this talk, [Jennifer Riggins](https://twitter.com/jkriggins) and [Paul Bruce](https://twitter.com/paulsbruce). Both gave me precious feedbacks and tips. Many great thanks to them!

I talked about an ideal world where API (and software) and documentation live in perfect harmony, describing some crazy ideas such as *documentation continuous delivery* or *documentation package manager* but also stating that we need both machines and humans to create this ideal world. [Jennifer Riggins](https://twitter.com/jkriggins) wrote a blog post about my [Document-API-topia](http://blog.smartbear.com/documentation/the-utopia-of-api-documentation/) published on Smartbear's Blog.
