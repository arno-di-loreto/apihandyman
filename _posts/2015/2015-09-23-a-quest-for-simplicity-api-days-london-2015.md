> A ROAST API is a SOAP API made by people who have vaguely heard of REST API

Right after REST Fest, I had the honor to give my first keynote at the first edition of [API Days London](http://london.apidays.io/) in September 2015. 

Join me in a *quest for simplicity* from an imaginary bank's IS depth to its API's heights.<!--more-->

> It's time to take the API matter seriously

Here are this keynote's video and slidedeck.
