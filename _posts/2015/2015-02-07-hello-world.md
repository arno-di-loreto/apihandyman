Welcome to the API Handyman blog!

*You can read a more complete presentation of the API Handyman blog [here](/about/).*

The API Handyman blog is about sharing my views and experiences on the API field from both provider and consumer points of view with (I hope) a pragmatic and unvarnished approach.
I hope you’ll enjoy reading my posts and I’m looking forward to your feedback and comments.
