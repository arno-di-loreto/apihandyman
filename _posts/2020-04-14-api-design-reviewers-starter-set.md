My 2019 talk, The API Design Reviewer's Starter Set, is about API design reviews and Dungeons and Dragons.
You'll find here its abstract, slides and video recorded at API Days London 2019.

# Abstract

What could go possibly wrong when designing APIs? Everything.
Among many other things, API Design may be inconsistent with pre-existing elements, may be bugged, may not fulfill needs, may be hard to understand or use, may be too specific and impossible to reuse, ...

Whatever the organization’s size, the type of APIs and the designers skills and experience, something will go wrong. That is why, any API design must be reviewed.

During this session, I uncover everything you need to start reviewing the designs of your organization’s APIs.

Explore subterranean needs! Plunder hoards of inconsistency! Battle legendary design flaws!
