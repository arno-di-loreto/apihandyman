Second post about about my first ever (recorded) live coding session.
While it started well, I was ready to record myself coding and talking.
preparing and recording this session turned out to be quite complicated.
At some moment, I was totally desperate and I thought I wasn't going to make it.

This live coding session was about the OpenAPI Specification, how to use it efficiently when designing and documenting API.
The idea was to write an OpenAPI Specification document and show the spec basic to advanced features, tips and tricks and use a few tools around all that.

Note that I'll soon start an OpenAPI Tips & Trick series including this session contents and a few other things I couldn't show during this session.

# Preparing content

# Adding titles and notes

Though this was a no slides session, I wanted to provide some indications about what was happening and I needed some speakers notes (especially during rehearsals).
