After API Days London, I've been to the Nordic APIs Summit in Stockholm for the second part of my OpenAPI specification (fka. Swagger specification) talk series with *OpenAPI Trek Into Fastness*. Fastness means being fast, but it also means being secured. In this session, I demonstrate how to secure and accelerate APIs' lifecycle with the OpenAPI specification. <!--more-->

# Abstract

Often reduced to Swagger UI and seen purely as a solution for generating API documentation, the OpenAPI (fka. Swagger) Specification format offers many possibilities that span the full API lifecycle. In this session we will identify some of the many advantages of this API definition from design to production, including topics such as design, mock, development, test, documentation continuous delivery, securely evolve an existing API. All this contributing in accelerating and securing API's lifecycle.
