My 2020 talk, _The Augmented API Design Reviewer_ is about (partial) API Design review automation with the OpenAPI Specification and Spectral.


# Abstract

API Design Reviews can be a total nightmare when it comes to check API Design Guidelines conformance. Hopefully, this can be automated using the OpenAPI Specification and Spectral, a JSON/YAML linter. Using these tools, you'll be able to focus on other more interesting tasks such as investigating if the API fullfils the identified needs. But that will only work if you know how to build and use Spectral rulesets. During this session you'll discover the basics of Spectral and how to actually use it at scale by discovering how to design rules and rulesets, how to ensure they actually work, and also by learning the differents ways of using Spectral.
