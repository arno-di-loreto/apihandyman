My talk _...And GraphQL for all? A few things to think about before blindly dumping REST for GraphQL_ which I gave at API Days Paris 2016 last December was recorded and the video is now available on [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/api-rest-graphql).

You can also read my write up [here on the blog](/and-graphql-for-all-a-few-things-to-think-about-before-blindly-dumping-rest-for-graphql/).

# Abstract

GraphQL is new. GraphQL is cool. Look! Github dumped REST for it! We MUST do it too! Well, why not. GraphQL could be a great tool, but like any tool, you don't choose it "just because".You choose it because it solves a problem in a given context. You choose it knowing its strengths and weaknesses.

During this session, while discovering what is GraphQL we will see what REST API providers should think about before blindly dumping REST for it. From design and implementation to pricing model and analytics down to developers experience and implementations, choosing an API design style will have impact on the whole API lifecycle. Therefore, this choice must be an enligthned one and not based on simple beliefs.
