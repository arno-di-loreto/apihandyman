I've attended and spoke at API Days Interface online conference last week. Being online made the experience a bit different but after almost 3 days, I felt almost as usual; exhausted and my brain boiling with all what I've heard and seen. This time I "came back" with a few thoughts on online conferences and various topics such as API design, governance and organization and also architecture, microservices and service mesh.

# Online conference

API Days Interface was my first online conference. It was a 2 days long conference with 3 to 4 parallel tracks, some workshops and even booths, just like a regular conference.
But this time, there was no travel abroad, only my bedroom. No IRL meetings, only me, my laptop and my webcam. The sessions were recorded live on the Pacific time zone and replayed 2 times on Asia and Europe time zones. Let me share my experience as both a speaker and an attended.

## Speaking at an online conference

My session was titled "The Augmented API Design Reviewer", it was about my journey to (partial) API design review automation using the OpenAPI specification and Spectral.

I prepared my session as usual. I wrote my speech, did a few rehearsal to ensure my story telling makes sense and ensure that it fits withing the allowed time range (25 minutes). Unfortunately, I had to cut out many elements to keep only what was the most important. I would have need more than 1 hours to tell the whole story (I'll tell all that in a blog post series). After that I chose a theme for my slide deck, after digging on the idea of the 6 Million Dollar Man (the 70s TV show), I finally choose Blade Runner (the original movie, the sequel does not exist).

The stage was my bedroom, my desk is there but unfortunately the wall behind me is just a boring white 

I did my Augmented API Design Reviewer session on tuesday morning (which actually was the evening for me in Paris)
