I"Š<p>Iâ€™m thrilled to announce that Iâ€™m writing a book about API design: <em>The Design of Everyday APIs</em> (edit: the book has been renamed <em>The Design of Web APIs</em> since this post has been written). This book is published by <em>Manning Publications</em> and the first two chapters are now available on the Manning Early Access Program or <a href="http://bit.ly/designwebapis">MEAP</a> (affiliate link, use fcclauret discount code to get 37% off). This book is for everyone who wants to learn API design.
But, whatâ€™s the story behind this book about API design? To answer this question, letâ€™s talk about my other passion: guitar.</p>
