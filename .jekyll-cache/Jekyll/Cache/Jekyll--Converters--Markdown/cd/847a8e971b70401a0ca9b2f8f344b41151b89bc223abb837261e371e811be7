I"®<p>There are quite many APIs out there taking advantage of all standard HTTP methods (<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PATCH</code>, <code>PUT</code> and <code>DELETE</code>). Unfortunately, there are still some cases where consumers canâ€™t use them all. As far as I know, <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> do not cause any problem at all. But as an API provider, do not take for granted that <code>DELETE</code>, <code>PUT</code> and the more dreaded <code>PATCH</code> HTTP methods can always be used by your consumers. I encountered this problem several times throughout the years and no later than a few weeks ago. Letâ€™s see why and how to solve this problem.</p>
