I"®<p>Join Frodo, Gollum and Gandalf on an epic API design adventure. In this session, based on my own experience defining and sharing API design common practices in my company and based on the API styles guides that I have collected on <a href="http://apistylebook.com">apistylebook.com</a>, we will discover why we desperately need API style guides and how they can or cannot help us create a smooth API surface for a company.</p>
