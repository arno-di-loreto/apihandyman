I"þ<p>After hundreds of API design reviews, I can tell that the most neglected aspect of API governance is ownership.
Unfortunately, thatâ€™s probably the most important one.
Without true ownership, your APIs will probably be totally wrong.
Without true ownership, your employees will be terribly sad or leave.
Without true ownership, your company may even die.
As an API design reviewer, I believe that my role is also to warn the teams Iâ€™m working with about this topic and help them to fix the problem.</p>
