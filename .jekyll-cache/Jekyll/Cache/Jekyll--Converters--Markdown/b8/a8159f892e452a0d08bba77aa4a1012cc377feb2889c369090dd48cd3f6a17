I"þ<p>Do you need to make a repetitive task that could be done through an API instead of a UI?
Do you need to make many API calls but donâ€™t want to code?
This post is made for you: youâ€™ll learn to use Postman and CSV files to batch API calls.
You may also learn a thing or two about API design, Github APIs (yes, plural) and other Postman features (variables, security, command line, visualizer, â€¦) in the making.
If you never have used Postman or Github APIs, no problem, everything will be explained.</p>
