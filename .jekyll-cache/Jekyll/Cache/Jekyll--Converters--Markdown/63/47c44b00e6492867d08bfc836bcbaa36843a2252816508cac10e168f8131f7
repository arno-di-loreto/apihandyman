I"8<p>When designing APIs, choosing HTTP status codes is not always that obvious and prone to errors, I hope this post series will help you to avoid common mistakes and choose an adapted one according to the context.
This first post answers the following question: given that a <code>GET /resources/123</code> request returns a <code>200 OK</code>, what should be the response to <code>DELETE /resources/123</code> if <code>DELETE</code> method is not implemented? <code>404 Not Found</code>, <code>405 Method Not Allowed</code> or <code>501 Not Implemented</code>?</p>
