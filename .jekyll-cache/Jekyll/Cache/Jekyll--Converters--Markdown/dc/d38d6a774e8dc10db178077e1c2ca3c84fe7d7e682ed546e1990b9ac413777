Since I started my <a href="/starting-a-swagger-journey-beyond-generated-swagger-ui/"><em>Swagger</em> journey</a>, there have been <em>some</em> changes. The <em>Swagger Specification</em> has been <a href="http://swagger.io/introducing-the-open-api-initiative/">donated</a> to the newly created <a href="https://openapis.org/news/announcement/2015/11/new-collaborative-project-extend-swagger-specification-building-connected">OpenAPI Initiative</a> under the Linux foundation and is reborn as the <em><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/04/the-openapi-specification-fka-the-swagger-specification/">OpenAPI Specification</a></em>. Therefore, my Swagger Journey will become an <em>OpenAPI Specification (fka Swagger Specification) Journey</em>.</p>
