I"Õ<p>Previous <a href="http://apihandyman.io/category/openapi-swagger-specification/">posts</a> showed how to write a highly accurate description of an API interface contract with the <a href="https://openapis.org/">OpenAPI specification</a>.

A fully documented OpenAPI specification file can provide some useful information and be used as a part of an APIâ€™s documentation.</p>
