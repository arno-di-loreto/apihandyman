I"i<p>The last <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/">API Strat 2016</a> day, after the last talk, a man living in kentucky asked me something like <em>What is the one thing you will remember about this conference?</em>. I answered something like <em>People First</em>.</p>

<p>People First. This is definitely what sticks in my mind after this conference.</p>
