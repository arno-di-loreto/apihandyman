<p><em>You can read a more complete presentation of the API Handyman blog <a href="/about/">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>The API Handyman blog is about sharing my views and experiences on the API field from both provider and consumer points of view with (I hope) a pragmatic and unvarnished approach.
I hope youâ€™ll enjoy reading my posts and Iâ€™m looking forward to your feedback and comments.</p>
