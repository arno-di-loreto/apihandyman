I"l<p>Thoughtworks is a quite famous software consultancy company, brilliant minds such as <a href="https://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> are working there.
Every 6 months, they publish their Technology Radar that I enjoy reading to discover new trends, techniques and tools and also to confront my own views to theirs about topics Iâ€™m already aware of.</p>
