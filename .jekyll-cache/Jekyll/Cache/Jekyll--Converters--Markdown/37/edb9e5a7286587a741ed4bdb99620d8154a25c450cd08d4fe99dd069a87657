I"„<p>When you design an API (even an internal/private one) upon an existing back office (to plug a mobile application on it for example), you should take care of one thing: an API is a display, not a window.
An APIâ€™s purpose is to expose your data and data processing but an API is only a <em>representation</em> and youâ€™re under no obligation to directly expose the crude reality.</p>
