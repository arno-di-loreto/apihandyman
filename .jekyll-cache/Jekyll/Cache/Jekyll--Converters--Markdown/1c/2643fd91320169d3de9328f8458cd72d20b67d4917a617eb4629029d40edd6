I"Û<p>Ever wanted to quickly find, extract or modify data coming from some JSON documents on the command line? JQ is the tool youâ€™re looking for. The three previous parts of this JQ and OpenAPI Series, taught us to extract data from JSON (OpenAPI) files and modify them using many filters, creating modules and using command line arguments. To finish this series, weâ€™ll learn to color JQâ€™s raw terminal output and do a colored version of part 2â€™s search operations.</p>
