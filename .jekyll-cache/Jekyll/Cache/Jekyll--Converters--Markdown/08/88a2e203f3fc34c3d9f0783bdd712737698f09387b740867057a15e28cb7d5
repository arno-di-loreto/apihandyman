I"b<p>If you wonder what means a 418 HTTP status code or which RFC defines the txn JWT claim, Web concepts is what you’re looking for. I just stopped doing HTTP/web/RFC related search, I now always check Erik Wilde’s web concepts first and usually find what I’m looking for instantly. Icing on the cake, all data is also available in JSON format.</p>
