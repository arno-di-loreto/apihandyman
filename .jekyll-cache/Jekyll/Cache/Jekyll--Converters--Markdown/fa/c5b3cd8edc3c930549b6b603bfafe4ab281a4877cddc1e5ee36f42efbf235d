I"n<p>I’ve attended and spoke at API Days Interface online conference on June 20, July 1 &amp; 2, 2020. Being online made the experience a bit different but after almost 3 days, I felt almost as usual; exhausted and my brain boiling with all what I’ve heard and seen. In this first post I share my feelings about attending and speaking at an online conference.</p>
