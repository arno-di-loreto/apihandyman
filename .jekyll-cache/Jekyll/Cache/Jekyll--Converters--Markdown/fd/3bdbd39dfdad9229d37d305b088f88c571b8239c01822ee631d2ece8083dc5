I"}<p>Using singular or plural to represent a list of something is an old debate in computer science, especially in the database field.

Who is wrong?
I have a preference, you may have another, but should we really give importance to such a debate?
Aren’t we missing something?
Let’s investigate that topic and discover what’s really important when choosing collection resource path.</p>
