I";<p>Ever wanted to quickly find, extract or modify data coming from some JSON documents on the command line? JQ is the tool you’re looking for. I use it every time I need to tranform, modify or extract some properties from an API’s response or analyze OpenAPI specification JSON files during my API reviews.</p>
